= Configurator

Configurator is a configuration toolkit strongly ispired by Sinatra's settings. 
Thanks to it you can easy implement configuration options to your app, module
or class. 

== Installation

You can install Configurator simply using rubygems:

  sudo gem install configurator
  
...or install it from source:

  git clone git://github.com/nu7hatch/configurator.git
  cd configurator
  rake install  

== Basic usage

Configurator is very easy to use. Take a look at simple example. 

  class MyClass do 
    set :foo, "bar"
    enable :bar
    disable :bla

    configure :production
      enable :bla
      set :spam, "eggs!"
    end
  end

Now you can get configured options directly from your class:

  MyClass.foo => "bar"
  MyClass.bar => true
  MyClass.bla => false

... or when current environment is set to <tt>:production</tt>:

  MyClass.bla  => true
  MyClass.spam => "eggs!"

All settings are also available from objects via <tt>#settings</tt> method:

  obj = MyObject.new
  obj.settings.foo => "bar"
  obk.settings.bar => true

<b>Remember!</b> when option is not set then <tt>NoMethodError</tt> will be
raised after try to get it direcly from class, eg:

  MyObject.set :exist
  MyObject.exist      => true
  MyObject.not_exist  => will raise NoMethodError
  
== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
